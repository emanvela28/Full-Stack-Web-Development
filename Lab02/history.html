    <p class="history-text">
        The idea of the motorcycle can be traced back to the late 19th century, when inventors sought ways to improve transportation 
        using small, motor-powered bicycles. The first true motorcycle, known as the <b>Daimler Reitwagen</b>, was built in <b>1885</b>
        by <b>Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach</b> in Germany. This machine, powered by an internal combustion engine, was 
        the foundation for the modern motorcycle. Over time, advancements in engineering led to mass production, the rise of 
        motorcycle racing, and innovations in design and performance. Today, motorcycles range from high-performance sports bikes 
        to long-distance touring machines, serving both practical and recreational purposes worldwide.
