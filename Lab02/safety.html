    <p class="safety-text">
        Motorcycle safety is crucial for riders of all experience levels, from beginners to seasoned motorcyclists. 
        Wearing a <b>DOT-approved helmet</b> significantly reduces the risk of serious head injuries, while 
        <b>protective gear</b> such as jackets, gloves, and boots provides essential protection in case of a fall. 
        Practicing <b>defensive riding</b>, staying <b>highly visible</b> to other drivers, and strictly 
        <b>following traffic laws</b> are key to minimizing risks on the road. Unlike cars, motorcycles lack an 
        external protective frame, making <b>awareness, caution, and preparedness</b> even more critical. 
        Ride responsibly, stay alert, and always make safety your top priority.
